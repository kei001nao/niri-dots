> **Notice**
> We don't take animation configs that are not **Custom Shaders!**
This means that they must be written in GLSL or any other graphics programming.

# How to use these.
you need a basic knowledge of how config files work
usually you're niri config should be in `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`
open it and scroll down until you see a `animations` line inside of it, you can copy and paste different configs into it.
We only add FULL animation blocks so delete you're current animation block in the niri config and replace it with such downloaded file.

You are allowed to ask for a animation, contribute, and download any of them all you like
Enjoy them!


# Current Issues;
Unravel Seems to have a error or non alignment where it does not draw the line based on how long the window is infact it just draws it to the screen width.
Here are the other videos for refrence
